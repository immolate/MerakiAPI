Thanks for coming! 


While I know this code as it currently sits is messy and needs some organization. It all functions "AS INTENDED" 

If you have any constructive feedback or suggestions or even some hatemail - I'm open to change or additions and subtractions if it'll help the cause! 

I currently work for an undisclosed MSP and find that this code has saved multiple hours of data entry already.

If you find this code useful, I encourage you to contribute in any way you can. 

Thanks!
